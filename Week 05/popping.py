# Week 5 - lecture 1 - lists & dicts
# indexing and slicing in lists
# he uses ipython on the CMD line for this but I am gonna try take most of it down here

aList = [ 2, 3.5, True, 'hi', {}, []]

## like reverse / append there are inbuilt methods to change and work with lists
## review these in order to know they exist
## eg. clear - removed elements from a list
## copy / extend / remove / reverse / count

# pop is one of them - this removes an element in a specified position

x = aList.pop(0)  # removes first element of a list and stores it in x

print(aList)
print(x)
