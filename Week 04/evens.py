# Lab 4.2 
# While loops

# Write a program that uses a while loop to print all the even numbers between 2 - 100
#counter controlled loop - you have set the parameters and will stop once it hits them

numberto = 100
evennumber = 4

while evennumber <= numberto:
    print (evennumber)
    evennumber += 2  ## goes upwards plus 2 each time (not negative)
