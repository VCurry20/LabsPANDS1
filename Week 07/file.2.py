# Creating, Opening, amending files through python
# use the open with module for files // when using this module you never have to worry about closing the file again

# This is for writing to a file - - - using # because it will create a file each time its run

#with open ("Outputtxt", "wt") as f:
#    f.write("Hello There! \nThis is a test")

# or print (" this is another way to do the above", file=f)

"""" The above code is in "wt" write mode - so it will keep overwriting on the file - to append us "at" """""
